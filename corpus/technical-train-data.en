EXTENSION OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD LAID DOWN IN THE ECB BANKNOTE RECYCLING FRAMEWORK FOR SIX EURO AREA COUNTRIES The Framework for the detection of counterfeits and fitness sorting by credit institutions and other professional cash handlers ( the « Framework ') , adopted in December 2004 and published on the ECB 's website 1 , provides for a transition period for credit institutions and other professional cash handlers to adapt procedures and existing machines in operation and thus to comply with the Framework .
This transition period will expire no later than the end of 2007 .
In the 2006 progress report on implementation of the Framework , the ECB Governing Council noted that due to specific issues affecting the cash-handling infrastructure and the scope of cash-handling in six euro area countries credit institutions and professional cash handlers would be unable to fully adjust existing banknote handling machines and related working procedures by the end of 2007 .
Pursuant to a decision of the Governing Council , the above-mentioned transition period has therefore been extended to expire : -- by the end of 2009 in France ;
and -- by the end of 2010 in Greece , Spain , Ireland , Italy and Portugal .
All other provisions of the Framework remain unchanged .

C 134/14
OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 19 April 2004 at the request of the Council of the European Union concerning a proposal for a Council regulation concerning the compilation and transmission of data on the quarterly government debt ( COM ( 2003 ) 761 final ) ( CON / 2004/14 ) ( 2004 / C 134/08 ) 1 .
On 5 March 2004 , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a Council regulation concerning the compilation and transmission of data on the quarterly government debt ( hereinafter the « proposed regulation ') .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community , as the data that will be compiled and transmitted in accordance with the proposed regulation will broaden the coverage of quarterly government data available for ECB monetary policy analysis .
In accordance with the first sentence of Article 17.5 of the Rules of Procedure of the ECB , the Governing Council has adopted this opinion .
The objective of the proposed regulation is the compilation and transmission of quarterly data on government debt as defined in Council Regulation ( EC ) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community ( 1 ) .
The proposed regulation does not alter the existing reporting requirements in the context of the excessive deficit procedure .
The ECB welcomes the proposed regulation as the data to be compiled under it will complement the sets of quarterly public finance statistics foreseen in the Action Plan on Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) Statistical Requirements ( hereinafter the « EMU Action Plan ') , established at the request of the Ecofin Council by the European Commission ( Eurostat ) in close cooperation with the ECB .
The EMU Action Plan is a response to the report of the Monetary Committee on information requirements in EMU , endorsed by the Ecofin Council on 18 January 1999 , and the second progress report on information requirements in EMU , endorsed by the Ecofin Council on 5 June 2000 .
The proposed regulation will contribute to the overall aim of compiling a consistent system of quarterly government accounts for the European Union and thus for the euro area .
It will supplement the existing sets of quarterly government data as specified in Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 264/2000 of 3 February 2000 on the implementation of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2223/96 with respect to shortterm public finance statistics ( 2 ) , Regulation ( EC ) No 1221/2002 of 10 June 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on quarterly non-financial accounts for general government ( 3 ) and Regulation ( EC ) No 501/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on quarterly financial accounts for general government ( 4 ) .
As the proposed regulation provides that the quarterly government debt data will have to be transmitted with the same deadline ( three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate ) as the data specified in the regulations mentioned in paragraph 5 , they can easily be integrated into the existing system of quarterly government accounts .

Introductory statement to the press conference on the chosen design of the international urban planning and architectural design competition for the New ECB Premises
by Jean-Claude Trichet , President of the European Central Bank ,
Frankfurt am Main , 20 January 2005
Ladies and gentlemen ,
We have invited you today for the presentation of the chosen design proposal in the international urban planning and architectural design competition for the New ECB Premises .
In our introductory remarks we would like to do the following : First , to briefly recall the main steps that have led to the outcome of the competition .
Second , to present the chosen design proposal in some detail .
And third , to explain what happens next .
Afterwards , we will be happy to answer further questions , as will the chosen architect when it comes to technical questions on the design proposal .
The decision of the Governing Council / the conclusion of the competition
Last Thursday , on 13 January 2005 , « the Governing Council chose the design for the ECB 's new premises out of the 3 revised design proposals of the 3 prize winners of the international urban planning and architectural design competition .
After extensive discussion and a careful evaluation , the Governing Council concluded that the revised design concept of Coop Himmelb ( l ) au best meets the functional and technical requirements specified by the ECB , and has features that reflect the ECB 's values and transforms them into architectural language ."
[ Quotation of the Press Release ] On 13 February 2004 an international jury consisting of architects , Eurosystem representatives and a representative of the City of Frankfurt chose three winning designs in accordance with the following criteria , as laid down in the Competition Rules out of the 12 design concepts submitted in the Second Phase of the competition :
Overall town-planning , architecture and landscape ;
Compliance with the main features of the functional and spatial programme , including modularity ;
Feasible approach to an energy / environmental concept and compliance with the main features of the ECB 's technical requirements ;
Compliance with the relevant rules , in particular in the field of building law and environmental law .
The first prize was awarded to Coop Himmelb ( l ) au , Vienna ;
the second prize to ASP Schweger Assoziierte , Berlin ;
and the third prize to 54f architekten + ingenieure , Darmstadt , in cooperation with T.R. Hamzah &amp; Yeang , Selangor .
On 18 March 2004 , the ECB 's Governing Council decided to invite all three prize winners to revise their design concepts in accordance with the Jury 's recommendations and the ECB 's requirements .
The purpose of this Revision Phase was to remedy the remaining functional and technical deficiencies of the concepts .
The final decision on the design concept to be implemented was made on the basis of the revised concepts and the criteria laid down in the Competition Rules .
In the Revision Phase each of the three teams has gone into depth of research and development , reaching a level of design for a new premises which would be suitable for the ECB and could be realistically constructed .
I would like to thank them for their work and have great respect for what they have created .
Each design proposal is unique in its own way . As we will , of course , only build one design , we , my colleagues from the Governing Council and myself , had then the difficult / challenging task to choose one of the revised design proposals .
We had then great pleasure to confirm the Jury 's proposal and to announce Coop Himmelb ( l ) au as the winning architect of the international urban planning and architectural design competition for the new ECB premises .
I would like to ask now Mr. Papademos , as he was also the Chairperson of the international jury of the competition , to present the main elements of the Governing Council decision for the chosen design of Coop Himmelb ( l ) au ..

28 January 2004 - Assessment of accession countries » securities settlement systems against the standards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in Eurosystem credit operations
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) will today publish a report entitled « Assessment of accession countries » securities settlement systems against the standards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in Eurosystem credit operations » . [ 1 ] ( pdf 637 kB ) .
In November 1997 , the European Monetary Institute established nine standards which securities settlement systems seeking to qualify for Eurosystem credit operations had , and have , to comply with .
They were published in January 1998 and are available on the ECB 's website ( pdf 111 kB ) .
These standards create the necessary framework for the mitigation of risks related to the settlement of credit operations and the safekeeping of collateral during these operations .
The main purpose of this assessment is to help central banks in the accession countries to identify those parts of their securities settlement arrangements that will still need to be addressed in order to facilitate the smooth functioning of Eurosystem credit operations .
A formal assessment of the eligibility of the respective securities settlement systems for Eurosystem credit operations will be carried out as soon as these systems hold collateral eligible for Eurosystem credit operations .
The assessment has revealed that the securities infrastructure in many accession countries may already be deemed relatively adequate .
Almost all of the 21 securities settlement systems that have been assessed could be considered eligible for use in Eurosystem credit operations under certain operational conditions . [ 2 ] It should be noted , however , that the securities settlement systems in the accession countries are not all equally advanced .
In most countries , the securities clearing and settlement infrastructure has largely been developed over the past decade .
Within this time frame , some accession countries have not sufficiently developed their securities infrastructure owing to a lack of resources as well as the low volume of securities traffic , which has hampered the recovery of initial investment costs .
A number of other countries , however , seem to have taken advantage of the fact that they had to build completely new infrastructures .
The relevant authorities in most countries have been strongly committed to bringing their infrastructures into line with internationally recognised standards .
Further details are provided in the report .
This publication is available on the ECB 's website ( http://www.ecb.europa.eu ) .
Hard copies are available on request from the ECB at the address given below .
[ 1 ] It is important to note that the term « accession countries » in this context refers to 12 countries in total , i.e. the ten acceding countries that are going to join the EU in May 2004 plus Bulgaria and Romania .
[ 2 ] In Cyprus , the government securities used for central bank credit operations are being dematerialised and the registers transferred from the Central Bank of Cyprus to the Central Depository and Central Registry ( CDCR ) .
Pending the completion of the project , which is foreseen for 2004 , the CDCR would be deemed eligible for Eurosystem credit operations on a pre-deposit basis combined with free delivery of securities .

﻿ Monetary policy
Price stability - objective of the Eurosystem
The primary objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability .
This is the key provision of the monetary policy chapter of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .
By focusing the monetary policy of the ECB on this objective , the Treaty incorporates modern economic thinking about the role , scope and limits of monetary policy and underlies the institutional and organisational set-up of central banking in Economic and Monetary Union .
The objective of maintaining price stability has been assigned by the Treaty for good reasons .
First , decades of practical experience and a large number of economic studies suggest that monetary policy will contribute most to improving economic prospects and raising the living standards of citizens by maintaining price stability in a lasting way .
Second , the theoretical foundations of monetary policy as well as experience drawn from the past demonstrate that monetary policy can ultimately only influence the price level in the economy .
Thus , maintaining stable prices is the only feasible objective for the single monetary policy over the medium term .
By contrast , apart from the positive impact of price stability , monetary policy has no scope for exerting any lasting influence on real variables .
The Eurosystem is required to act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition , favouring an efficient allocation of resources .

Tasks of the national central banks
The operational set-up of the Eurosystem takes account of the principle of decentralisation .
The national central banks ( NCBs ) perform almost all operational tasks of the Eurosystem .
In doing so , they enact the decisions made centrally by the Governing Council of the ECB .
The NCBs are responsible for
Execution of monetary policy operations : this means that the NCBs carry out the actual transactions , such as providing the commercial banks with central bank money .
Operational management of the ECB 's foreign reserves : this includes the execution and the settlement of the market transactions necessary to invest the ECB 's foreign reserves .
Management of their own foreign reserves : planned NCB operations in this area are subject to approval from the ECB , if such transactions could affect exchange rates or domestic liquidity conditions and if they exceed certain limits established by ECB guidelines . The aim is to ensure consistency with the monetary and exchange rate policy of the ECB .
Operation and supervision of payment systems : payment systems are a means to transfer money within the banking system .
Since May 2008 each NCB and its respective national user community have been able to participate in the single platform TARGET2 , the payment system for the euro .
Other private payment and security settlement systems also exist ;
they are supervised to ensure their smooth functioning .
Joint issuance of banknotes together with the ECB : both the ECB and the NCBs are issuers of euro banknotes .
All banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs , which accommodate any demand for euro banknotes by launching annual banknote production orders and by operating a Eurosystem-wide stock management system .
Both activities are coordinated by the ECB .
NCBs take measures to achieve a high quality of banknotes in circulation and to analyse counterfeits .
Collection of statistics and providing assistance to the ECB : the ECB requires a wide range of economic and financial data to support the conduct of its monetary policy and the fulfilment of other Eurosystem tasks .
The main areas where the NCBs help by collecting data from the national financial institutions are i ) money , banking and financial markets , ii ) balance of payments statistics and on the Eurosystem 's international reserves , and iii ) financial accounts .
Functions outside the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) : national central banks may also perform functions other than those specified in the Statute unless the Governing Council finds , by a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast , that these interfere with the objectives and tasks of the ESCB .
Such functions are the responsibility of the national central banks .

Brussels , 15.12.2003 COM ( 2003 ) 783 final
Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION Concerning the signing of the Hague Convention on the Law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary
The great majority of securities in the financial markets are now held in electronic book entry form in securities accounts with custodians or depositaries or settlement systems resulting in proprietary rights in or for the delivery or transfer of the securities concerned .
This has caused some difficulty in applying the traditional conflict of laws principle under which proprietary aspects of dispositions of property are governed by the law of the place where the property in question is situated at the time ( the lex situs or lex rei sitae ) , since for securities , electronically stored , it is often difficult to identify where such securities are located .
This creates uncertainty with regard to the law , e.g. which law collateral providers and collateral takers need to comply with in the creation of interests in collateral and in their perfection .
The difficulties are particularly acute where the securities are held through a chain of intermediaries in different countries .
The Hague Securities Convention 2 .
In order to agree on a world-wide uniform formula to reduce the above-mentioned legal uncertainties in cross-border situations , the Hague Conference , the world-wide intergovernmental organisation with the purpose to work for the progressive unification of the rules of private international law , started in May 2000 to work on a future Convention on the law applicable to proprietary rights in indirectly held securities .
In autumn 2000 , the Hague Conference constituted a working group with experts from Member States of the Conference and associations specialised in the field in collaboration with other international organisations , notably UNCITRAL and UNIDROIT .
The working group met in January 2001 and January 2002 .
The European Commission participated in the working group as an observer and , at the final stage , negotiated the Convention on behalf of the Community ( see paragraph 14 ) .
The final text of the Hague Convention on « The law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary » , hereinafter the Hague Securities Convention , was agreed on December 13 , 2002 at the end of the Hague Conference 's 19th diplomatic session .
All Member States and 7 Accession Countries by signing the Final Act certified that the text of the Convention was indeed the one resulting from the negotiations .
Altogether 53 States that are Members of the Hague Conference signed the final act , including the USA , Japan , Australia , Brazil , Argentina and the Russian Federation .
The Commission not being a Member of the Hague Conference did not sign the Final Act .
The Hague Convention is a Multilateral Treaty .
The underlying legal formula is based on the choice of law of the intermediary and its customer , which is a variant of PRIMA ( Place of the Relevant Intermediary Approach ) .
The Convention states that the applicable law is the one named in the account agreement with the relevant intermediary , backed by a so-called « reality test » intended to ensure that the intermediary does actually conduct securities business in that jurisdiction , even though not necessarily in relation to the account in question .
Reasons for the implementation of the Hague Securities Convention 5 .
The Member States by signing the Final Act on 13 December 2002 stated that they supported the approach adopted by the Convention and , by implication , that were also willing to accept the adaptation of EU law where necessary .
This position was confirmed unanimously at the Coreper meeting of 11 December 2002 .
A number of existing directives also contain provisions to be used to determine the applicable law governing a securities account .
The formula used in these directives , is that the account is governed by the law of the country where the account is located .
There is therefore a conflict between the approach in the Convention and existing Community law .
According to Article 18 of the Hague Securities Convention a Regional Economic Integration Organisation , which is constituted by sovereign States and has competence over certain matters governed by the Convention may similarly ( as Member States to the Hague Conference and other Contracting states ) sign , accept , approve or accede to the Convention .
The Regional Economic Integration Organisation shall in that case have the rights and obligations of a Contracting State , to the extent that that Organisation has competence over matters governed by the Convention .
The European Union is to be understood as one Regional Economic Integration Organisation in the sense of Article 18 of the Hague Securities Convention .
The Commission considers that the implementation of the Hague Securities Convention will , to a considerable extent , contribute to enhancing the free movement of capital in the Internal Market and world wide by removing uncertainties as to the applicable law and thereby allowing wider trade in securities between Member States as well as on the international capital markets .
The negotiations in the Hague for the new Convention and the negotiations in Brussels concerning a proposal for the Collateral Directive ( 2002/47 / EC ) were running most of the time in parallel with the first feeding into the second as can be seen in the joint statement by the Council and the Commission in the minutes of the Council of 5 March 2002 adopting the Common position on the Collateral Directive .
Given that the Collateral Directive is one of the measures foreseen in the Financial Services Action Plan ( FSAP ) 1 , the implementation of the Hague Securities Convention may also be seen as a measure to fulfil the FSAP objectives and therefore its conclusion ( signature and ratification ) may be also considered as to be bound by the same time-frame .
At the meetings held with Member States on 19 May 2003 and 8 July 2003 , on the implementation of the Hague Convention , there was a unanimous call for a rapid signature and subsequent ratification of the Convention .
COM ( 1999 ) 232 final of 11 May 1999
The ratification of the Hague Convention has been urged by the G-30 (" Global Clearing and Settlement -- A Plan of Action » , Group of Thirty , released on January 23 , 2003 ) .
Specifically , its Recommendation Nr 15 when referring to the Choice-oflaw rules indicates that : « Financial supervisors and legislators should ensure that the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities Held with an Intermediary , adopted on December 13 , 2002 , is signed and ratified by their respective nations as soon as is reasonably possible .
The Hague Convention , once ratified by all relevant nations , will ensure that there will be a clear and certain answer to the question in an international setting as to which law governs in determining whether a collateral taker has received a perfected interest in pledged securities » .
The signature of the Hague Securities Convention will send therefore an important political signal to all parties concerned and in particular to the financial services industry .
Signature by the Community and its Member States , but also as many as possible of the relevant third countries , members of the Hague Conference , such as the USA will ensure the success of the agreement .
Procedural matters 14 .
The Commission was authorised to negotiate at the Hague Conference by Council decision on 28 November 2002 .
Following the signature of the Hague Securities Convention , the Commission will put forward proposals to amend the necessary directives , such as the Collateral and Settlement Finality Directives , at the same time as the proposal for a Council decision , which requires the assent of the European Parliament , to ratify or accede to the Hague Securities Convention .
In a favourable scenario the accession to / ratification of the Hague Securities Convention may take place by the end of 2004 or early 2005 .

CHAPTER II -- APPLICABLE LAW Article 4 Primary rule 1 .
The law applicable to all the issues specified in Article 2 ( 1 ) is the law in force in the State expressly agreed in the account agreement as the State whose law governs the account agreement or , if the account agreement expressly provides that another law is applicable to all such issues , that other law .
The law designated in accordance with this provision applies only if the relevant intermediary has , at the time of the agreement , an office in that State , which -- a ) alone or together with other offices of the relevant intermediary or with other persons acting for the relevant intermediary in that or another State -- i ) effects or monitors entries to securities accounts ;
ii ) administers payments or corporate actions relating to securities held with the intermediary ;
or iii ) is otherwise engaged in a business or other regular activity of maintaining securities accounts ;
or b ) is identified by an account number , bank code , or other specific means of identification as maintaining securities accounts in that State .
For the purposes of paragraph ( 1 )( a ) , an office is not engaged in a business or other regular activity of maintaining securities accounts -- a ) merely because it is a place where the technology supporting the bookkeeping or data processing for securities accounts is located ;
b ) merely because it is a place where call centres for communication with account holders are located or operated ;
c ) merely because it is a place where the mailing relating to securities accounts is organised or files or archives are located ;
or d ) if it engages solely in representational functions or administrative functions , other than those related to the opening or maintenance of securities accounts , and does not have authority to make any binding decision to enter into any account agreement .
In relation to a disposition by an account holder of securities held with a particular intermediary in favour of that intermediary , whether or not that intermediary maintains a securities account on its own records for which it is the account holder , for the purposes of this Convention -- a ) that intermediary is the relevant intermediary ;
b ) the account agreement between the account holder and that intermediary is the relevant account agreement ;
c ) the securities account for the purposes of Article 5 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is the securities account to which the securities are credited immediately before the disposition .
Fall-back rules 1 .
If the applicable law is not determined under Article 4 , but it is expressly and unambiguously stated in a written account agreement that the relevant intermediary entered into the account agreement through a particular office , the law applicable to all the issues specified in Article 2 ( 1 ) is the law in force in the State , or the territorial unit of a Multi-unit State , in which that office was then located , provided that such office then satisfied the condition specified in the second sentence of Article 4 ( 1 ) .
In determining whether an account agreement expressly and unambiguously states that the relevant intermediary entered into the account agreement through a particular office , none of the following shall be considered -- a ) a provision that notices or other documents shall or may be served on the relevant intermediary at that office ;
b ) a provision that legal proceedings shall or may be instituted against the relevant intermediary in a particular State or in a particular territorial unit of a Multi-unit State ;
c ) a provision that any statement or other document shall or may be provided by the relevant intermediary from that office ;
d ) a provision that any service shall or may be provided by the relevant intermediary from that office ;
e ) a provision that any operation or function shall or may be carried on or performed by the relevant intermediary at that office .
If the applicable law is not determined under paragraph ( 1 ) , that law is the law in force in the State , or the territorial unit of a Multi-unit State , under whose law the relevant intermediary is incorporated or otherwise organised at the time the written account agreement is entered into or , if there is no such agreement , at the time the securities account was opened ;
if , however , the relevant intermediary is incorporated or otherwise organised under the law of a Multi-unit State and not that of one of its territorial units , the applicable law is the law in force in the territorial unit of that Multi-unit State in which the relevant intermediary has its place of business , or , if the relevant intermediary has more than one place of business , its principal place of business , at the time the written account agreement is entered into or , if there is no such agreement , at the time the securities account was opened .
If the applicable law is not determined under either paragraph ( 1 ) or paragraph ( 2 ) , that law is the law in force in the State , or the territorial unit of a Multi-unit State , in which the relevant intermediary has its place of business , or , if the relevant intermediary has more than one place of business , its principal place of business , at the time the written account agreement is entered into or , if there is no such agreement , at the time the securities account was opened .

b ) the places where certificates representing or evidencing securities are located ;
c ) the place where a register of holders of securities maintained by or on behalf of the issuer of the securities is located ;
or d ) the place where any intermediary other than the relevant intermediary is located .

In this Article -- a ) « the new law » means the law applicable under this Convention after the change ;
b ) « the old law » means the law applicable under this Convention before the change .
Subject to paragraph ( 4 ) , the new law governs all the issues specified in Article 2 ( 1 ) .
Except with respect to a person who has consented to a change of law , the old law continues to govern -- a ) the existence of an interest in securities held with an intermediary arising before the change of law and the perfection of a disposition of those securities made before the change of law ;
b ) with respect to an interest in securities held with an intermediary arising before the change of law -- i ) the legal nature and effects of such an interest against the relevant intermediary and any party to a disposition of those securities made before the change of law ;
ii ) the legal nature and effects of such an interest against a person who after the change of law attaches the securities ;
iii ) the determination of all the issues specified in Article 2 ( 1 ) with respect to an insolvency administrator in an insolvency proceeding opened after the change of law ;
c ) priority as between parties whose interests arose before the change of law .
Paragraph ( 4 )( c ) does not preclude the application of the new law to the priority of an interest that arose under the old law but is perfected under the new law .
Article 8 Insolvency 1 .
Notwithstanding the opening of an insolvency proceeding , the law applicable under this Convention governs all the issues specified in Article 2 ( 1 ) with respect to any event that has occurred before the opening of that insolvency proceeding .
Nothing in this Convention affects the application of any substantive or procedural insolvency rules , including any rules relating to -- 12
a ) the ranking of categories of claim or the avoidance of a disposition as a preference or a transfer in fraud of creditors ; or b ) the enforcement of rights after the opening of an insolvency proceeding .
CHAPTER III -- GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 9 General applicability of the Convention This Convention applies whether or not the applicable law is that of a Contracting State .

Article 11 Public policy and internationally mandatory rules 1 .
The application of the law determined under this Convention may be refused only if the effects of its application would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the forum .
This Convention does not prevent the application of those provisions of the law of the forum which , irrespective of rules of conflict of laws , must be applied even to international situations .
This Article does not permit the application of provisions of the law of the forum imposing requirements with respect to perfection or relating to priorities between competing interests , unless the law of the forum is the applicable law under this Convention .
Article 12 Determination of the applicable law for Multi-unit States 1 .

b ) the references to « that State » in the second sentence of Article 4 ( 1 ) are to the Multi-unit State itself .

A Multi-unit State may , at the time of signature , ratification , acceptance , approval or accession , make a declaration that if , under Article 5 , the applicable law is that of the Multiunit State or one of its territorial units , the internal choice of law rules in force in that Multiunit State shall determine whether the substantive rules of law of that Multi-unit State or of a particular territorial unit of that Multi-unit State shall apply .
A Multi-unit State that makes such a declaration shall communicate information concerning the content of those internal 13 choice of law rules to the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law .
A Multi-unit State may , at any time , make a declaration that if , under Article 4 , the applicable law is that of one of its territorial units , the law of that territorial unit applies only if the relevant intermediary has an office within that territorial unit which satisfies the condition specified in the second sentence of Article 4 ( 1 ) .
Such a declaration shall have no effect on dispositions made before that declaration becomes effective .
Article 13 Uniform interpretation In the interpretation of this Convention , regard shall be had to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its application .
Article 14 Review of practical operation of the Convention The Secretary General of the Hague Conference on Private International Law shall at regular intervals convene a Special Commission to review the practical operation of this Convention and to consider whether any amendments to this Convention are desirable .
CHAPTER IV -- TRANSITION PROVISIONS Article 15 Priority between pre-Convention and post-Convention interests In a Contracting State , the law applicable under this Convention determines whether a person 's interest in securities held with an intermediary acquired after this Convention entered into force for that State extinguishes or has priority over another person 's interest acquired before this Convention entered into force for that State .

If the Contracting State is a Multiunit State , it may make such a declaration with respect to any of its territorial units .
Any express terms of an account agreement which would have the effect , under the rules of the State whose law governs that agreement , that the law in force in a particular State , or a territorial unit of a particular Multi-unit State , applies to any of the issues specified in Article 2 ( 1 ) , shall have the effect that such law governs all the issues specified in Article 2 ( 1 ) , provided that the relevant intermediary had , at the time the agreement was entered into , an office in that State which satisfied the condition specified in the second sentence of Article 4 ( 1 ) .
A Contracting State may , at the time of signature , ratification , acceptance , approval or 14 accession , make a declaration that its courts shall not apply this paragraph with respect to an account agreement described in this paragraph in which the parties have expressly agreed that the securities account is maintained in a different State .

ANNEX II Declaration concerning the competence of the European Community with regard to matters governed by the Hague Convention of 13 December 2002 on the Law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary 1 .
Article 18 ( 1 ) of the Hague Convention provides that a Regional Economic Integration Organisation which is constituted by sovereign States and has competence in respect of certain matters governed by this Convention , may become a party to it .
The current Members States of the European Community are the Kingdom of Belgium , the Kingdom of Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , the Hellenic Republic , the Kingdom of Spain , the French Republic , Ireland , the Italian Republic , the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , the Kingdom of the Netherlands , the Republic of Austria , the Portuguese Republic , the Republic of Finland , the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland .
On 1 May 2004 the Republic of Cyprus , the Czech Republic , the Republic of Estonia , the Republic of Hungary , the Republic of Latvia , the Republic of Lithuania , the Republic of Malta , the Republic of Poland , the Slovak Republic and the Republic of Slovenia will also be Member States of the European Community .
This declaration is not applicable to the territories of the Member States in which the , Treaty establishing the European Community does not apply and is without prejudice to such acts or positions as may be adopted under the Convention by the Member States concerned on behalf of and in the interests of those territories .
The European Community has competence according to the EC Treaty to adopt general and specific measures to enhance the uniformity of rules relating to the applicable law in various domains in its Member States .
In respect of matters covered by the Convention , the Community has already exercised this competence by the adoption of the European Community directives , such as the Settlement Finality3 and Collateral4 directives , containing provisions to be used to determine the applicable law governing a securities account .
Hence , in this field , it is for the Community to enter into external undertakings with third States or competent organisations .
The exercise of competence which the Member States have transferred to the Community pursuant to the EC Treaty is , by its nature , liable to continuous development .
In the framework of the Treaty , the competent institutions may take decisions which determine the extent of the competence of the European Community .
The European Community therefore reserves the right to amend the present declaration accordingly , without this constituting a prerequisite for the exercise of its competence with regard to matters governed by the Hague Convention .

The Governing Council of the ECB has no objection to the Council 's Recommendation on the appointment of the proposed candidate as President of the ECB .
The Governing Council of the ECB has adopted this opinion in accordance with Article 112 ( 2 )( b ) of the Treaty and Article 11.2 and Article 43.3 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank .
This opinion shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union .

Introduction This document presents the operational framework chosen by the Eurosystem * for the single monetary policy in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union .
The document , which forms part of the Eurosystem 's legal framework for monetary policy instruments and procedures , is intended to serve as the « General documentation » on the monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem , particularly aiming to provide counterparties with the information they need in relation to the Eurosystem 's monetary policy framework .
The « General documentation » does not in itself confer rights on counterparties nor impose obligations .
The legal relationship between the Eurosystem and its counterparties is established in appropriate contractual or regulatory arrangements .
This document is divided into seven chapters : Chapter 1 gives an overview of the operational framework for the monetary policy of the Eurosystem .
In Chapter 2 eligibility criteria for counterparties taking part in Eurosystem monetary policy operations are specified .
Chapter 3 describes open market operations , while Chapter 4 presents the standing facilities available to counterparties .
Chapter 5 specifies procedures applied in the execution of monetary policy operations .
In Chapter 6 the eligibility criteria for underlying assets in monetary policy operations are defined .
Chapter 7 presents the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system .
Annexes to the document contain examples of monetary policy operations , a glossary , criteria for the selection of counterparties to Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations , a presentation of the reporting framework for the money and banking statistics of the European Central Bank , a list of the ECB and national central bank websites and a description of the procedures and sanctions to be applied in the event of non-compliance with counterparty obligations .
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank has agreed to use the term « Eurosystem » as an expression denoting the composition in which the European System of Central Banks performs its basic tasks , i.e. the national central banks of the Member States which have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community and the European Central Bank .
Chapter 1
Overview of the monetary policy framework
Overview of the monetary policy framework The European System of Central Banks conducts open market operations , offers standing facilities and requires credit institutions to hold minimum reserves on accounts with the Eurosystem .
The European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) consists of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the national central banks of the EU Member States .
1 The activities of the ESCB are carried out in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community ( Treaty ) and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank ( Statute of the ESCB ) .
The ESCB is governed by the decision-making bodies of the ECB .
In this respect , the Governing Council of the ECB is responsible for the formulation of monetary policy , while the Executive Board is empowered to implement monetary policy according to the decisions and guidelines laid down by the Governing Council .
To the extent deemed possible and appropriate and with a view to ensuring operational efficiency , the ECB shall have recourse to the national central banks2 to carry out the operations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem .
The Eurosystem monetary policy operations are executed on uniform terms and conditions in all Member States .
1.3.1 Open market operations Open market operations play an important role in the monetary policy of the Eurosystem for the purposes of steering interest rates , managing the liquidity situation in the market and signalling the stance of monetary policy .
The Eurosystem has available five types of instruments for the conduct of open market operations .
The most important instrument is reverse transactions ( applicable on the basis of repurchase agreements or collateralised loans ) .
The Eurosystem may also use outright transactions , the issuance of debt certificates , foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits .
Open market operations are initiated by the ECB , which also decides on the instrument to be used and the terms and conditions for their execution .
They can be executed on the basis of standard tenders , quick tenders or bilateral procedures . 4 With regard to their aim , regularity and procedures , the Eurosystem 's open market operations can be divided into 1 It should be noted that national central banks of Member States which have not adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community ( Treaty ) retain their powers in the field of monetary policy according to national law and are thus not involved in the conduct of the single monetary policy .
Throughout this document , the term « national central banks » refers to the national central banks of the Member States which have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty .
Throughout this document , the term « Member State » refers to a Member State which has adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty . The different procedures for the execution of Eurosystem open market operations , i.e. standard tenders , quick tenders and bilateral procedures , are specified in Chapter 5 .
Objectives of the Eurosystem
The primary objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability , as defined in Article 105 of the Treaty .
Without prejudice to the primary objective of price stability , the Eurosystem has to support the general economic policies in the European Community .
In pursuing its objectives , the Eurosystem has to act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition , favouring an efficient allocation of resources .
4 ECB -* The single monetary policy in Stage Three -* November 2000
the following four categories ( see also Table 1 ) :
The main refinancing operations are regular liquidity-providing reverse transactions with a weekly frequency and a maturity of two weeks .
These operations are executed by the national central banks on the basis of standard tenders .
The main refinancing operations play a pivotal role in pursuing the purposes of the Eurosystem 's open market operations and provide the bulk of refinancing to the financial sector .
The longer-term refinancing operations are liquidity-providing reverse transactions with a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months .
These operations aim to provide counterparties with additional longer-term refinancing and are executed by the national central banks on the basis of standard tenders .
In these operations , the Eurosystem does not , as a rule , intend to send signals to the market and therefore normally acts as a rate taker .
Fine-tuning operations are executed on an ad hoc basis with the aim of managing the liquidity situation in the market and of steering interest rates , in particular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market .
Fine-tuning operations are primarily executed as reverse transactions but can also take the form of outright transactions , foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits .
The instruments and procedures applied in the conduct of fine-tuning operations are adapted to the types of transactions and the specific objectives pursued in the operations .
Finetuning operations are normally executed by the national central banks through quick tenders or bilateral procedures .
The Governing Council of the ECB will decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , fine-tuning bilateral operations may be executed by the ECB itself .
In addition , the Eurosystem may carry out structural operations through the issuance of debt certificates , reverse transactions and outright transactions .
These operations are executed whenever the ECB wishes to adjust the structural position of the Eurosystem vis-à-vis the financial sector ( on a regular or nonregular basis ) .
Structural operations in the form of reverse transactions and the issuance of debt instruments are carried out by the national central banks through standard tenders .
Structural operations in the form of outright transactions are executed through bilateral procedures . -*
1.3.2 Standing facilities Standing facilities aim to provide and absorb overnight liquidity , signal the general stance of monetary policy and bound overnight market interest rates .
Two standing facilities are available to eligible counterparties on their own initiative , subject to their fulfilment of certain operational access conditions ( see also Table 1 ) : -*
Counterparties can use the marginal lending facility to obtain overnight liquidity from the national central banks against eligible assets .
Under normal circumstances , there are no credit limits or other restrictions on counterparties » access to the facility apart from the requirement to present sufficient underlying assets .
The interest rate on the marginal lending facility normally provides a ceiling for the overnight market interest rate .
Counterparties can use the deposit facility to make overnight deposits with the national central banks .
Under normal circumstances , there are no deposit limits or other restrictions to counterparties » access to the facility .
The interest rate on the deposit facility normally provides a floor for the overnight market interest rate .
1.3.3 Minimum reserves The Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system applies to credit institutions in the euro area and primarily pursues the aims of stabilising money market interest rates and creating ( or enlarging ) a structural liquidity shortage .
The reserve requirement of each institution is determined in relation to elements of its balance sheet . In order to pursue the aim of stabilising interest rates , the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system enables institutions to make use of averaging provisions .
Compliance with the reserve requirement is determined on the basis of the institutions » average daily reserve holdings over a one-month maintenance period . Institutions » holdings of required reserves are remunerated at the rate of the Eurosystem 's main refinancing operations .
Counterparties
The Eurosystem monetary policy framework is formulated with a view to ensuring participation of a broad range of counterparties .
Institutions subject to minimum reserves according to Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB may access the standing facilities and participate in open market operations based on standard tenders .
The Eurosystem may select a limited number of counterparties to participate in fine-tuning operations .
For outright transactions , no restrictions are placed a priori on the range of counterparties .
For foreign exchange swaps conducted for monetary policy purposes , active players in the foreign exchange market are used .
The set of counterparties for these operations is limited to those institutions selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations which are located in the euro area .
( i.e. liquidity-providing operations ) have to be based on adequate collateral .
The Eurosystem accepts a wide range of assets underlying its operations .
A distinction is made , essentially for purposes internal to the Eurosystem , between two categories of eligible assets : « tier one » and « tier two » respectively .
Tier one consists of marketable debt instruments fulfilling uniform euro area-wide eligibility criteria specified by the ECB .
Tier two consists of additional assets , marketable and non-marketable , which are of particular importance for national financial markets and banking systems and for which eligibility criteria are established by the national central banks , subject to ECB approval .
No distinction is made between the two tiers with regard to the quality of the assets and their eligibility for the various types of Eurosystem monetary policy operations ( except that tier two assets are normally not used by the Eurosystem in outright transactions ) .
Eligible assets may be used on a cross-border basis , by means of the correspondent central banking model ( CCBM ) or through eligible links between EU securities settlement systems ( SSS ) , to collateralise all types of Eurosystem credit .
5 All assets eligible for Eurosystem monetary policy operations can also be used as underlying assets for intraday credit .
Modifications to the monetary policy framework
The Governing Council of the ECB may , at any time , change the instruments , conditions , criteria and procedures for the execution of Eurosystem monetary policy operations . 1.5

Eligible counterparties
Eligible counterparties General eligibility criteria -*
participate in Eurosystem open market operations based on standard tenders .
Counterparties to Eurosystem monetary policy operations must fulfil certain eligibility criteria .
6 These criteria are defined with a view to giving a broad range of institutions access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations , enhancing equal treatment of institutions across the euro area and ensuring that counterparties fulfil certain operational and prudential requirements :
Only institutions subject to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system according to Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB are eligible to be counterparties .
Institutions which are exempt from their obligations under the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system ( see Section 7.2 ) are not eligible to be counterparties to Eurosystem standing facilities and open market operations ;
Counterparties must be financially sound .
They should be subject to at least one form of EU / EEA harmonised supervision by national authorities .
7 However , financially sound institutions subject to non-harmonised national supervision of a comparable standard can also be accepted as counterparties , e.g. branches established in the euro area of institutions that have their head office outside the European Economic Area ;
Counterparties must fulfil any operational criteria specified in the relevant contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the respective national central bank ( or the ECB ) , so as to ensure the efficient conduct of Eurosystem monetary policy operations .
Institutions may access the Eurosystem standing facilities and open market operations based on standard tenders only through the national central bank of the Member State in which the institution is established .
If an institution has establishments ( head office and branches ) in more than one Member State , each establishment has access to these operations through the national central bank of the Member State in which it is located , notwithstanding the fact that the tender bids of an institution may only be submitted by one establishment ( either the head office or a designated branch ) in each Member State .
Selection of counterparties for quick tenders and bilateral operations -*
For outright transactions , no restrictions are placed a priori on the range of counterparties .
For foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes , counterparties must be able to conduct large-volume foreign exchange operations efficiently under all market conditions . The range of counterparties to foreign exchange swaps corresponds to the counterparties located in the euro area which are selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations .
The criteria and procedures applied for the selection of counterparties for foreign exchange intervention operations are presented in Annex 3 . For other operations based on quick tenders and bilateral procedures ( fine-tuning reverse transactions and the collection of fixed-term
For outright transactions , no restrictions are placed a priori on the range of counterparties .
Harmonised supervision of credit institutions is based on the Directive 2000/12 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions .
deposits ) , each national central bank selects a set of counterparties from among the institutions established in its Member State which fulfil the general counterparty eligibility criteria .
In this respect , activity in the money market is the prime selection criterion .
Other criteria which might be taken into account are , for example , the efficiency of the trading desk and the bidding potential .
In quick tenders and bilateral operations , the national central banks deal exclusively with the counterparties which are included in their respective set of fine-tuning counterparties .
If , for operational reasons , a national central bank cannot deal in each operation with all its fine-tuning counterparties , the selection of counterparties in this Member State will be based on a rotation scheme in order to ensure equitable access .
The Governing Council of the ECB will decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , fine-tuning bilateral operations may be carried out by the ECB itself .
If the ECB were to carry out bilateral operations , the selection of counterparties would in such cases be made by the ECB according to a rotation scheme among those counterparties in the euro area which are eligible for quick tenders and bilateral operations in order to ensure equitable access .
ECB Regulations and Decisions relating to the application of minimum reserves .
The relevant sanctions and the procedural rules for their application are specified in the above-mentioned Regulations .
In addition , in the case of serious infringements of the minimum reserve requirements , the Eurosystem may suspend counterparties from participation in open market operations .
In accordance with provisions in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the respective national central bank ( or by the ECB ) , the Eurosystem shall impose financial penalties on counterparties or suspend counterparties from participation in open market operations if counterparties fail to comply with their obligations under the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the national central banks ( or by the ECB ) as set out below .
This relates to cases of infringement of tender rules ( if a counterparty is not able to transfer a sufficient amount of underlying assets to settle the amount of liquidity it has been allotted in a liquidity-providing operation or if it is not able to deliver a sufficient amount of cash to settle the amount it has been allotted in a liquidity-absorbing operation ) , and of bilateral transactions ( if a counterparty is not able to deliver a sufficient amount of eligible underlying assets or if it is not able to deliver a sufficient amount of cash to settle the amount agreed in bilateral transactions ) .
This also applies to cases of non-compliance by a counterparty with the rules for the use of underlying assets ( if a counterparty is using assets which are or which have become ineligible , e.g. due to close links between , or identity of issuer and counterparty ) , and to non-compliance with the rules for end-of-day procedures and access conditions to the marginal lending facility ( if a counterparty which has a negative balance on the settlement account at the end of the day does not fulfil the access conditions for the marginal lending facility ) . 2.3
11 In addition , a suspension measure to be taken vis-à-vis the non-complying counterparty may be applied to branches of the same institution located in other Member States .
Where , as an exceptional measure , this is required given the seriousness of a case of non-compliance , as evidenced by its frequency or duration , for instance , a counterparty may be suspended from all future monetary policy operations for a certain period of time .
Financial penalties imposed by national central banks in the event of non-compliance in relation to a breach of the rules concerning tender operations , bilateral transactions , underlying assets , end-of-day procedures or the access conditions to the marginal lending facility shall be calculated at a pre-specified penalty rate ( as set out in Annex 6 ) .
Suspension or exclusion on grounds of prudence
In accordance with provisions in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the respective national central bank ( or by the ECB ) , the Eurosystem may suspend or exclude counterparties » access to monetary policy instruments on the grounds of prudence .
In addition , suspension or exclusion of counterparties may be warranted in some cases falling within the notion of the « default » of a counterparty as defined in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the national central banks .
Chapter 3
Open market operations
Open market operations the asset is transferred to the creditor , while the parties agree to reverse the transaction through a re-transfer of the asset to the debtor at a future point in time ) or as collateralised loans ( i.e. an enforceable security interest is provided over the assets but , assuming fulfilment of the debt obligation , the ownership of the asset is retained by the debtor ) . Further provisions for reverse transactions based on repurchase agreements are specified in the contractual arrangements applied by the respective national central bank ( or the ECB ) .
Open market operations play an important role in the Eurosystem 's monetary policy , pursuing the aims of steering interest rates , managing the liquidity situation in the market and signalling the stance of monetary policy .
With regard to their aim , regularity and procedures , Eurosystem open market operations can be divided into four categories : main refinancing operations , longer-term refinancing operations , finetuning operations and structural operations .
As for the instruments used , reverse transactions are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystem and can be employed in all four categories of operations , whereas debt certificates may be used for structural absorption operations .
In addition , the Eurosystem has three other instruments available for the conduct of fine-tuning operations : outright transactions , foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixedterm deposits .
In the following sections , specific features of the different types of open market instruments used by the Eurosystem are presented in detail .
3.1 Reverse transactions
3.1.1 General considerations a. Type of instrument
Reverse transactions refer to operations where the Eurosystem buys or sells eligible assets under repurchase agreements or conducts credit operations against eligible assets as collateral .
Reverse transactions are used for the main refinancing operations and the longer-term refinancing operations .
In addition , the Eurosystem can use reverse transactions for structural and fine-tuning operations . b. Legal nature
The difference between the purchase price and the repurchase price in a repurchase agreement corresponds to the interest due on the amount of money borrowed or lent over the maturity of the operation , i.e. the repurchase price includes the respective interest to be paid .
The interest rate on a reverse transaction in the form of a collateralised loan is determined by applying the specified interest rate on the credit amount over the maturity of the operation .
The interest rate applied to Eurosystem reverse open market operations is a simple interest rate with the day-count convention « actual / 360 » .
3.1.2 Main refinancing operations The main refinancing operations are the most important open market operations conducted by the Eurosystem , playing a pivotal role in pursuing the aims of steering interest rates , managing the liquidity situation in the market and signalling the stance of monetary policy .
They also provide the bulk of refinancing to the financial sector .
The operational features
The national central banks may execute reverse transactions either in the form of repurchase agreements ( i.e. the ownership of 14
ECB -* The single monetary policy in Stage Three -* November 2000 of the main refinancing operations can be summarised as follows :
-* -* They are liquidity-providing operations ;
They are executed regularly each month ;
10 They normally have a maturity of three months ;
11 They are executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ;
They are executed through standard tenders ( as specified in Section 5.1 ) ; All counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria ( as specified in Section 2.1 ) may submit tender bids for the longer-term refinancing operations ;
-* -* -* -* -* -* They are liquidity-providing operations ;

8 They normally have a maturity of two weeks ;
9 They are executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ;
They are executed through standard tenders ( as specified in Section 5.1 ) ;
All counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria ( as specified in Section 2.1 ) may submit tender bids for the main refinancing operations ;
Both tier one and tier two assets ( as specified in Chapter 6 ) are eligible as underlying assets for the main refinancing operations .
3.1.4 Fine-tuning reverse operations The Eurosystem can execute fine-tuning operations in the form of reverse open market transactions .
Fine-tuning operations aim to manage the liquidity situation in the market and to steer interest rates , in particular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market .
3.1.3 Longer-term refinancing operations The Eurosystem also executes regular refinancing operations with a three-month maturity , which are aimed at providing additional longer-term refinancing to the financial sector .
These operations represent only a limited part of the global refinancing volume .
In these operations , the Eurosystem does not , as a rule , intend to send signals to the market and therefore normally acts as a rate taker . Accordingly , longer-term refinancing operations are usually executed in the form of variable rate tenders and from time to time the ECB indicates the operation volume to be allotted in forthcoming tenders .
Under exceptional circumstances , the Eurosystem may also execute longer-term refinancing operations through fixed rate tenders . The operational features of the longer-term refinancing operations can be summarised as follows :
The main and the longer-term refinancing operations are executed in accordance with the Eurosystem 's pre-announced tender operations calendar , which can be found on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.int ; see also Section 5.1.2 ) ;
information can also be found on the websites of the national central banks ( see Annex 5 ) .
9 The maturity of the main and the longer-term refinancing operations may occasionally vary depending on , inter alia , bank holidays in Member States .
10 See footnote 8 .
11 See footnote 9 .
They can take the form of liquidityproviding or liquidity-absorbing operations ;
Their frequency is not standardised ;
Their maturity is not standardised ;
Liquidity-providing fine-tuning reverse transactions are normally executed through quick tenders , although the possibility of using bilateral procedures is not excluded ( see Chapter 5 ) ;
Liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning reverse transactions are executed , as a rule , through bilateral procedures ( as specified in Section 5.2 ) ;
They are normally executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ( the Governing Council of the ECB will decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , bilateral finetuning reverse operations may be executed by the ECB ) ;
The Eurosystem may select , according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 , a limited number of counterparties to participate in fine-tuning reverse operations ;
Both tier one and tier two assets ( as specified in Chapter 6 ) are eligible as underlying assets for fine-tuning reverse operations .
3.2 a.
Outright transactions Type of instrument
Outright open market transactions refer to operations where the Eurosystem buys or sells eligible assets outright on the market .
Outright open market operations are executed only for structural and fine-tuning purposes .
b. Legal nature
3.1.5 Structural reverse operations The Eurosystem may execute structural operations in the form of reverse open market transactions aimed at adjusting the structural position of the Eurosystem vis-àvis the financial sector .
The operational features of these operations can be summarised as follows : An outright transaction implies a full transfer of ownership from the seller to the buyer with no connected reverse transfer of ownership .
The transactions are executed in accordance with the market conventions for the debt instrument used in the transaction .
c. Price terms
In the calculation of prices , the Eurosystem acts in accordance with the most widely accepted market convention for the debt instruments used in the transaction .
d. Other operational features
-* -* They are liquidity-providing operations ;
Their frequency can be regular or nonregular ;
The operational features of Eurosystem outright transactions can be summarised as follows :
They can take the form of liquidityproviding ( outright purchase ) or liquidityabsorbing ( outright sales ) operations ;
They are executed through bilateral procedures ( as specified in Section 5.2 ) ;
They are normally executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ( the Governing Council of the ECB will decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , fine-tuning outright operations may be executed by the ECB ) ;
No restrictions are placed a priori on the range of counterparties to outright transactions ;
Only tier one instruments ( as specified in Section 6.1 ) are normally used as underlying assets in outright transactions . as to create ( or enlarge ) a liquidity shortage in the market .
The certificates constitute a debt obligation of the ECB vis-à-vis the holder of the certificate .
The certificates are issued and held in a book-entry form in securities depositories in the euro area .
The ECB does not impose any restrictions on the transferability of the certificates .
Further provisions related to the certificates will be contained in the terms and conditions for ECB debt certificates .
c. Interest terms -*
The certificates are issued in discount form , i.e. they are issued at below the nominal amount and are redeemed at maturity at the nominal amount .
The difference between the issue amount and the redemption amount equals the interest accrued on the issue amount , at the agreed interest rate , over the maturity of the certificate .
The calculation of the issue amount is shown in Box 1 .

Foreign exchange swaps Type of instrument
Foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes consist of simultaneous spot and forward transactions of the euro against foreign currency . They are used for fine-tuning purposes , mainly with the aim of managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates .
Foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes refer to operations where the Eurosystem buys ( or sells ) euro spot against a foreign currency and , at the same time , sells ( or buys ) it back forward at a specified repurchase date .

Collection of fixed-term deposits Type of instrument d.
Other operational features
The Eurosystem may invite counterparties to place remunerated fixed-term deposits with the national central bank in the Member State in which the counterparty is established .
The collection of fixed-term deposits is envisaged only for fine-tuning purposes in order to absorb liquidity in the market .
The operational features of the collection of fixed-term deposits can be summarised as follows :
The collection of deposits is normally executed through quick tenders , although the possibility of using bilateral procedures is not excluded ( see Chapter 5 ) ; The collection of deposits is normally executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ( the Governing Council of the ECB will decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , the
The deposits accepted from counterparties are for a fixed term and with a fixed rate of interest .
No collateral is given by the national central banks in exchange for the deposits .

Standing facilities
4 4.1 a.
Standing facilities The marginal lending facility Type of instrument in which the institution is established .
Access to the marginal lending facility is granted only on days when the relevant national RTGS ( real-time gross settlement ) system and the relevant SSS ( s ) are operational .
13 At end-of-day , counterparties » intraday debit positions on their settlement account with the national central banks are automatically considered to be a request for recourse to the marginal lending facility .
The procedures for end-of-day access to the marginal lending facility are specified in Section 5.3.3 .
A counterparty may also be granted access to the marginal lending facility by sending a request to the national central bank in the Member State in which the counterparty is established .
In order for the national central bank to process the request on the same day , the request must be received by the national central bank at the latest 30 minutes after the actual closing time of TARGET .
14 As a general rule , the closing time for the TARGET system is 6 p.m. ECB time ( C.E.T. ) .
The deadline for requesting access to the marginal lending facility is postponed by an additional 30 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve maintenance period .
15 In the request , the amount of credit is to be stated and , if underlying assets for the transaction have not already been pre-deposited with the national central bank , the underlying assets to be delivered for the transaction are to be specified . Apart from the requirement to present 13 National central banks which have their national RTGS system operational when the TARGET Interlinking component is closed shall grant access to the standing facilities .
The closing time for access to the standing facilities will then be 30 minutes after the closing time of the relevant national RTGS system .
14 In some Member States , the national central bank ( or some of its branches ) may not be open for the purpose of conducting monetary policy operations on certain Eurosystem business days due to national or regional bank holidays .
In this case , the relevant national central bank is responsible for informing the counterparties in advance of the arrangements to be applied for access to the marginal lending facility in relation to the bank holiday .
15 TARGET closing days are announced on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.int ) ;
information can also be found on the websites of the national central banks ( see Annex 5 ) .
Counterparties may use the marginal lending facility to obtain overnight liquidity from national central banks at a pre-specified interest rate against eligible assets ( as specified in Chapter 6 ) .
The facility is intended to satisfy counterparties » temporary liquidity needs .
Under normal circumstances , the interest rate on the facility provides a ceiling for the overnight market interest rate .
The terms and conditions of the facility are identical throughout the euro area .
The national central banks may provide liquidity under the marginal lending facility either in the form of overnight repurchase agreements ( i.e. the ownership of the asset is transferred to the creditor , while the parties agree to reverse the transaction through a re-transfer of the asset to the debtor on the next business day ) or as overnight collateralised loans ( i.e. an enforceable security interest is provided over the assets but , assuming fulfilment of the debt obligation , ownership of the asset is retained by the debtor ) .
Further provisions for repurchase agreements are specified in the contractual arrangements applied by the respective national central bank .
Arrangements for providing the liquidity in the form of collateralised loans take account of the different procedures and formalities required to enable the establishment and subsequent realisation of a relevant interest in the collateral ( a pledge ) which apply in different jurisdictions .
c. Access conditions
Institutions fulfilling the general counterparty eligibility criteria specified in Section 2.1 may access the marginal lending facility .
Access to the marginal lending facility is granted through the national central bank in the Member State

The maturity of credit extended under the facility is overnight .
For counterparties participating directly in TARGET , the credit is repaid on the next day on which the relevant national RTGS system and the relevant SSS ( s ) are operational , at the time at which those systems open .
The interest rate is announced in advance by the Eurosystem and is calculated as a simple interest rate with the day-count convention « actual / 360 » .
The ECB may change the interest rate at any time , with effect not earlier than the following Eurosystem business day .
16 Interest under the facility is payable with the repayment of the credit .
e. Suspension of the facility
Institutions fulfilling the general counterparty eligibility criteria specified in Section 2.1 may access the deposit facility .
Access to the deposit facility is granted through the national central bank in the Member State in which the institution is established .
Access to the deposit facility is granted only on days when the relevant national RTGS system is open .
To be granted access to the deposit facility , the counterparty must send a request to the national central bank in the Member State in which the counterparty is established .
In order for the national central bank to process the request on the same day , the request must be received by the national central bank at the latest 30 minutes after the actual closing time of TARGET , which is , as a general rule , 6 p.m. ECB time ( C.E.T. ) . 19 The deadline for requesting access to the deposit facility is postponed by an additional 30 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve maintenance period .
The deposit facility Type of instrument 16 Throughout this document , the term « Eurosystem business day » refers to any day on which the ECB and at least one national central bank are open for the purpose of conducting Eurosystem monetary policy operations .
17 Operational differences resulting from the existence of different account structures across the national central banks may exist across euro area countries .
18 Owing to the existence of different account structures across the national central banks , the ECB may allow national central banks temporarily to apply access conditions which are slightly different from those referred to here .
The national central banks will provide information on any such deviations from the access conditions described in this document .
19 In some Member States the national central bank ( or some of its branches ) may not be open for the purpose of conducting Eurosystem monetary policy operations on certain Eurosystem business days owing to national or regional bank holidays .
In such cases , the relevant national central bank is responsible for informing the counterparties in advance of the arrangements to be made for access to the deposit facility in relation to the bank holiday .
20 TARGET closing days are announced on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.int ) ; information can also be found on the websites of the national central banks ( see Annex 5 ) .
Counterparties can use the deposit facility to make overnight deposits with national central banks . The deposits are remunerated at a pre-specified interest rate .
Under normal circumstances , the interest rate on the facility provides a floor for the overnight market interest rate . The terms and conditions of the deposit facility are identical throughout the euro area .

Procedures
Procedures Tender procedures ECB may decide to adjust the time frame in individual operations , if deemed appropriate .
The main refinancing operations , the longerterm refinancing operations and structural operations ( with the exception of outright transactions ) are always executed in the form of standard tenders .
Counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria specified in Section 2.1 may participate in standard tenders .
b. Quick tenders
5.1.1 General considerations Eurosystem open market operations are normally executed in the form of tender procedures .
The Eurosystem tender procedures are performed in six operational steps as specified in Box 3 .
The Eurosystem distinguishes between two different types of tender procedures : standard tenders and quick tenders .
The procedures for standard and quick tenders are identical except for the time frame and the range of counterparties .
a. Standard tenders
Standard tenders are executed within 24 hours from the announcement of the tender to certification of the allotment result ( where the time between the submission deadline and the announcement of the allotment result is approximately two hours ) .
Chart 1 gives an overview of the normal time frame for the operational steps for standard tenders . The
Quick tenders are normally executed within one hour from the announcement of the tender to certification of the allotment result .
The normal time frame for the operational steps for quick tenders is specified in Chart 2 .
The ECB may decide to adjust the time frame in individual operations , if deemed appropriate .
Quick tenders are only used for the execution of fine-tuning operations .
The Eurosystem may select , according to the criteria and procedures specified in Section 2.2 , a limited number of counterparties to participate in quick tenders .

Fixed rate and variable rate tenders
The Eurosystem has the option of conducting either fixed rate ( volume ) or variable rate ( interest ) tenders .
In a fixed rate tender , the ECB specifies the interest rate in advance and participating counterparties bid the amount of money they want to transact at the fixed interest rate .
21 In a variable rate tender , counterparties bid the amounts of
money and the interest rates at which they want to enter into transactions with the national central banks .
22 21 In fixed rate foreign exchange swap tenders , the ECB fixes the swap points of the operation and the counterparties offer the amount of currency kept as fixed that they wish to sell ( and buy back ) or buy ( and sell back ) at that rate .
22 In variable rate foreign exchange swap tenders , the counterparties bid the amount of the currency kept as fixed and the swap point quotation at which they wish to enter into the operation .

5.1.2 Tender operations calendar a. Main and longer-term refinancing operations the reimbursement day are NCB business days participate in such operations .
5.1.3 Announcement of tender operations The main and the longer-term refinancing operations are executed according to an indicative calendar published by the Eurosystem .
23 The calendar is published at least three months before the start of the year for which it is valid .
The normal trade days for the main and the longer-term refinancing operations are specified in Table 2 .
The ECB aims to ensure that counterparties in all Member States can participate in the main and the longer-term refinancing operations .
Therefore , when compiling the calendar for these operations , the ECB makes appropriate adjustments to the normal schedule so as to take into account bank holidays in the individual Member States .
b. Structural operations Eurosystem standard tenders are publicly announced by means of wire services .
In addition , national central banks may announce the tender operation directly to counterparties without access to wire services . The public tender announcement message normally contains the following information :
the type of auction ( fixed rate or variable rate tender ) ; -* Structural operations through standard tenders are not executed according to any pre-specified calendar .
However , structural operations are normally conducted and settled only on days which are NCB business days24 in all Member States . c. Fine-tuning operations
-* Fine-tuning operations are not executed according to any pre-specified calendar .
The ECB may decide to conduct fine-tuning operations on any Eurosystem business day . Only national central banks of Member States where the trade day , the settlement day and
23 The calendar for the Eurosystem 's tender operations can be found on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.int ) ;
24 Throughout this document , the term « NCB business day » refers to any day on which the national central bank of a specific Member State is open for the purpose of conducting Eurosystem monetary policy operations .
In some Member States branches of the national central bank may be closed on NCB business days owing to local or regional bank holidays .
In such cases , the relevant national central bank is responsible for informing the counterparties in advance of the arrangements to be made for transactions involving those branches .

the ISIN code of the issue ( in the case of the issuance of debt certificates ) .
The announcement of quick tenders follows the same procedures as those for standard tenders .
In a quick tender , regardless of whether it is announced publicly or not , the selected counterparties are contacted directly by the national central banks .
5.1.4 Counterparties » preparation and submission of tender bids Counterparties » tender bids must be in a form that follows the pro forma example provided by the national central banks for the relevant operation .
The tender bids must be submitted to the national central bank of a Member State in which the institution has an establishment ( head office or branch ) .
The tender bids of an institution may only be submitted by one establishment ( either the head office or a designated branch ) in each Member State .
In fixed rate tenders , counterparties shall state in their bids the amount of money that they are willing to transact with the national central banks .
25 In variable rate tenders , counterparties may submit bids for up to ten different interest rate / price / swap point levels .
In each bid they shall state the amount of money that they are willing to transact with the national central banks , and the respective interest rate .
However , under exceptional circumstances , the ECB may decide not to announce quick tenders publicly in advance . 25 In fixed rate foreign exchange swaps , the amount of the currency kept fixed that the counterparty is willing to transact with the Eurosystem is to be stated .
26 With regard to the issuance of ECB debt certificates , the ECB may decide that bids are to be expressed in the form of a price rather than an interest rate .
In such cases , prices shall be quoted as a percentage of the nominal amount .
27 In variable rate foreign exchange swaps , the amount of the currency kept fixed that the counterparty is willing to transact with the Eurosystem and the respective swap point level are to be stated . ECB -* The single monetary policy in Stage Three -* November 2000
29 For the main refinancing operations , the minimum bid amount is EUR 1,000,000 .
Bids exceeding the minimum bid amount must be expressed as multiples of EUR 100,000 .
The same minimum bid and multiple amounts are applied in fine-tuning and structural operations .
The minimum bid amount is applied to each individual interest rate / price / swap point level .
For the longer-term refinancing operations , each national central bank defines a minimum bid amount in the range from EUR 10,000 to EUR 1,000,000 .
Bids exceeding the minimum bid amount must be expressed as multiples of EUR 10,000 .
The minimum bid amount is applied to each individual interest rate level .
The ECB may impose a maximum bid limit in order to prevent disproportionately large bids .
Any such maximum bid limit is always specified in the public tender announcement message .
Counterparties are expected always to be in a position to cover the amounts allotted to them by a sufficient amount of eligible underlying assets .
28 The contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the respective national central bank allow the imposition of penalties if a counterparty is not able to transfer a sufficient amount of underlying assets or cash to settle the amount it has been allotted in a tender operation .
Bids are revocable up to the tender submission deadline .
Bids submitted after the deadline specified in the tender announcement message are invalid .
Respect of the deadline is judged by the national central banks .
The national central banks discard all the bids of a counterparty if the aggregate amount bid exceeds any maximum bid limit established by the ECB .
The national central banks also discard any bid which is below the minimum bid amount or which is below any minimum or above any maximum accepted interest rate / price / swap point .
Furthermore , the national central banks may discard bids which are incomplete or which do not follow the pro forma example .
If a bid is discarded , the respective national central bank informs the counterparty about its decision prior to the tender allotment .
5.1.5 Tender allotment procedures a. Fixed rate tender operations
In the allotment of a fixed rate tender , the bids received from counterparties are added together .
If the aggregate amount bid exceeds the total amount of liquidity to be allotted , the submitted bids will be satisfied pro rata , according to the ratio of the amount to be 28 Or to settle in cash in the case of liquidity-absorbing operations .

The amount allotted to each counterparty is rounded to the nearest euro . However , the ECB may decide to allot a minimum amount / ratio to each bidder in fixed rate tenders .
b. Variable rate tenders in euro In the allotment of liquidity-providing variable rate tenders in euro , bids are listed in diminishing order of offered interest rates .
Bids with the highest interest rate levels are
satisfied as having priority and bids with successively lower interest rates are accepted until the total liquidity to be allotted is exhausted .
If , at the lowest interest rate level accepted ( i.e. the marginal interest rate ) , the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted , the remaining amount is allocated pro rata among the bids according to the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal interest rate ( see Box 5 ) .
The amount allotted to each counterparty is rounded to the nearest euro .

In the allotment of liquidity-absorbing variable rate tenders ( which may be used for the issuance of debt certificates and the collection of fixed-term deposits ) , bids are listed in increasing order of offered interest rates ( or diminishing order of offered prices ) .
Bids with the lowest interest rate ( highest price ) levels are satisfied as having priority and bids with successively higher interest rates ( lower price bids ) are accepted until the total liquidity to be absorbed is exhausted .
If , at the highest interest rate ( lowest price ) level accepted ( i.e. the marginal interest rate / price ) , the aggregate bid amount exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted , the remaining amount is allocated pro rata among the bids according to the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total bid amount at the marginal interest rate / price ( see Box 5 ) .
For the issuance of debt certificates , the amount allotted to each counterparty is rounded to the nearest multiple of the denomination of the debt certificates .
For other liquidityabsorbing operations , the amount allotted to each counterparty is rounded to the nearest euro . The ECB may decide to allot a minimum amount to each successful bidder in variable rate tenders .
In the allotment of liquidity-absorbing variable rate foreign exchange swap tenders , bids are listed in diminishing order of offered swap point quotations . The bids with the highest swap point quotations are satisfied as having priority and successively lower swap point quotations are accepted until the total amount of the fixed currency to be absorbed is exhausted .
If , at the lowest swap point quotation accepted ( i.e. the marginal swap point quotation ) , the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted , the remaining amount is allocated pro rata among the bids according to the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal swap point quotation ( see Box 6 ) . The amount allotted to each counterparty is rounded to the nearest euro .
In the allotment of liquidity-providing variable rate foreign exchange swap tenders , bids are listed in increasing order of swap point quotations . 29 The bids with the lowest swap point quotations are satisfied as having priority and successively higher swap point quotations are accepted until the total amount of the fixed currency to be allotted is exhausted .
If , at the highest swap point quotation accepted ( i.e. the marginal swap point quotation ) , the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted , the remaining amount is allocated pro rata among the bids according to the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal swap point quotation ( see Box 6 ) .
For variable rate tenders , the Eurosystem may apply either single rate or multiple rate auction procedures .
In a single rate auction ( Dutch auction ) , the allotment interest rate / price / swap point applied for all satisfied bids is equal to the marginal interest rate / price / swap point ( i.e. the interest rate / price / swap point at which the total allotment was exhausted ) . In a multiple rate auction ( American auction ) , the allotment interest rate / price / swap point is equal to the interest rate / price / swap point offered for each individual bid .
29 Swap point quotations are listed in increasing order taking into account the sign of the quotation , which depends on the sign of the interest rate differential between the foreign currency and the euro . If , for the maturity of the swap , the foreign currency interest rate is higher than the corresponding interest rate for the euro , the swap point quotation is positive ( euro quoted at premium against the foreign currency ) .

In addition , national central banks may announce the allotment result directly to counterparties without access to wire services .
The public tender result message normally contains the following information :
-* -* -* the number of bidders ;
the currencies involved ( in the case of foreign exchange swaps ) ;
the percentage of allotment ( in the case of fixed rate tenders ) ;
the spot exchange rate ( in the case of foreign exchange swaps ) ;
the marginal interest rate / price / swap point accepted and the percentage of allotment at the marginal interest rate / price / swap point ( in the case of variable rate tenders ) ;
reference number of the tender operation ;
-* the date of the tender operation ;
the type of operation ;

the minimum individual allotment amount ( if any ) ;
the minimum allotment ratio ( if any ) ;
the denomination of the certificates ( in the case of the issuance of debt certificates ) ; the ISIN code of the issue ( in the case of the issuance of debt certificates ) .
If the Governing Council of the ECB were to decide that , under exceptional circumstances , bilateral operations could also be executed by the ECB itself ( or by one or a few national central banks acting as the operating arm of the ECB ) , the procedures for such operations would be adapted accordingly . In this case , the ECB ( or the national central bank ( s ) acting as the operating arm of the ECB ) would directly contact one or a few counterparties in the euro area , selected according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 .
5.2 a.
Procedures for bilateral operations General considerations The national central banks may execute operations on the basis of bilateral procedures .
30 Bilateral procedures may be used for fine-tuning open market operations and structural outright operations .
Bilateral procedures are defined in a broad sense as any procedures where the Eurosystem conducts a transaction with one or a few counterparties without a tender .
In this respect , two different types of bilateral procedures can be distinguished : operations where counterparties are contacted directly by the Eurosystem , and operations executed through stock exchanges and market agents .
b. Direct contact with counterparties
The national central banks can execute outright transactions through stock exchanges and market agents .
For these operations , the range of counterparties is not restricted a priori and the procedures are adapted to the market conventions for the debt instruments transacted .
The Governing Council of the ECB will decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , the ECB itself ( or one or a few national central banks acting as the operating arm of the ECB ) may execute fine-tuning outright operations through stock exchanges and market agents .
In this procedure , the national central banks directly contact one or a few domestic counterparties , which are selected according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 .
